# [55. Jump Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/)

## Problem Description
Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Determine if you are able to reach the last index.

## Example(s)
Example 1:
```
Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
```

## Solution Explanation
```

```

## Additional Notes/Links
A similar question is on CSDoJo; the differentiating factor being that the CSDoJo one returns success if it's possible to leave the array (i.e. go to any index greater than the last index of the array) & not just to the last index exactly.
